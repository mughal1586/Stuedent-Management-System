Student Management System

Description
This C++ program manages student data, allowing the user to input and display information for students.

Features
-   Takes student name, roll number, marks, and percentage as input.
-   Stores and displays student details.
-   Utilizes classes and objects to represent students.
-   Demonstrates the use of getters and setters.
-   Includes functions to insert and display student data.

Code Structure
The code consists of three files:

-   `main.cpp`: Contains the main function, which demonstrates the creation of student objects, setting their data, and displaying student information. It also takes input from the user to insert and display details for another student.
-   `Student.cpp`: Contains the implementation of the Student class methods (getters, setters, insert, and display).
-   `header.h`: Contains the declaration of the Student class.

Dependencies
-   iostream: For input/output operations.
-   string: For handling string data (student names).

Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the program, save the files with a .cpp extension (e.g., main.cpp, Student.cpp, header.cpp) and use a C++ compiler.
